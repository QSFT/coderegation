Many believe the future of design is in screens. They're wrong. Our love for the digital interface is out of control. This conversation, led by Golden Krishna, will explore a better path: NoUI. Eliminating counterintuitive input mechanisms for natural inputs inverts the contemporary focus of software design to have computers adapt for people, rather than people adapt for computers. The results can have a profound impact on your design process and our lives.
