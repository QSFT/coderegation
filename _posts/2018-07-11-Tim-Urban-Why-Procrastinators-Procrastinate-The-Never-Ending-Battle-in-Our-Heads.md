Tim Urban, Creator, Wait But Why

In college, Tim Urban’s procrastination problem got so bad that he found himself writing the first word of his 90-page senior thesis only 72 hours before it was due. After spending years trying to understand how his own mind worked, he finally put his thoughts down on paper, creating three cartoon stick drawings—the Rational Decision-Maker, the Instant Gratification Monkey, and the Panic Monster—to represent the major “players” in his head that battled over the steering wheel. A hilarious presentation that consistently delights and inspires audiences, it is one of the 50 most-watched TED talks of all time.
