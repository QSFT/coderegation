Let’s face it: writing documentation is fundamentally boring. Unless you’re a total graphomaniac, chances are you are not writing as much documentation as you should be, or if you do, you find it hard to organize it in a useful manner. Grab a cup of coffee and join me on a journey of the good, the bad and the ugly parts of writing documentation. By the time we are finished, you will find writing and reading documentation a lot easier.

About János Pásztor: even though he likes tinkering with technology as much as the next guy, during the last year his focus has shifted to documenting existing technologies, quirks and most importantly: business requirements. Unsatisfied with existing state of most documentation, he tries to apply visuals to make documentation work better.
