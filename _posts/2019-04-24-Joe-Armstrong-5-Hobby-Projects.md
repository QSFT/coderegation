'How to Make the World a Better Place?' This has been a Work in Progress for Joe over the past 40 years and whilst he doesn't pretend to have all the answers, he will nevertheless present, as he calls them, 'some of his half-baked ideas and prototypes' to the room. According to Joe, Erlang also started off as a 'half-baked idea' and a few small prototypes, so we might be in for a treat with this one. In this talk, Joe will be asking questions around the themes of software entropy reduction, making a personal computation infrastructure, adding trust to the web and storing data forever, to name just a few, but, as the name suggests, changing the world is a work in progress - for all of us.
