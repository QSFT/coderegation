Launching new features is hard. This is especially true when you have an established user base that expects more than a half-baked MVP. How do you build things your customers will love without letting scope get out of hand?

This talk will examine the lifecycle of a feature, from ideation through release and review. Using real examples of feature successes and failures, it will offer insights on ways to manage your feature development to be able to deliver value to market incrementally without tarnishing your productâ€™s reputation.
