This talk will outline the scale of Google’s codebase, describe Google’s custom-built monolithic source repository, and discuss the reasons behind choosing this model of source control management. It will include background on the systems and workflows used at Google that make managing and working productively with a large repository feasible, in addition to a discussion of the advantages and trade-offs of this approach.
