In last year’s keynote “Great Engineering, Failed Product” I discussed the ten biggest reasons why products fail. Unfortunately, many people told me that they suffer from each of these problems. So they asked me if I could talk more about the alternative. So in this talk, I will describe what I consider to be the ten most critical characteristics and behaviors of highly effective product teams. Not just of good teams, but of truly strong teams that consistently innovate and provide value for their customers and their business. I have long argued that there is a very dramatic difference between how the best teams work, and how most teams work. In last year’s talk you saw the serious issues in how most teams work. In this year’s talk, you’ll see how the best teams work.
