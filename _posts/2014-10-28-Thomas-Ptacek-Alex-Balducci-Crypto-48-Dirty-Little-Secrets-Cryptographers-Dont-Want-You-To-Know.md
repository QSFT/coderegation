Cryptography lets secrets remain secret, or at least that's the idea. In the security business we often discover that a given crypto method isn't quite as secure as hoped, whether due to unforeseen edge cases or direct interference by unfriendly parties.

Over 10,000 people participated in the Matasano crypto challenges, a staged learning exercise where participants implemented 48 different attacks against realistic cryptographic constructions. This has resulted in a crypto exploit codebase spanning dozens of languages, from X86 assembly to Haskell. In 48 Dirty Little Secrets Cryptographers Don't Want You To Know Thomas Ptacek and Alex Balducci will walk you through all 48 challenges, putting them into context and going in-depth on some of the most interesting.
