The talk overviews async/await, asynchronous generators and comprehensions in Python 3.6 and the asyncio module. We'll discuss when and how asyncio should be used in a modern applications and services, what is uvloop, and what asyncio frameworks and libraries one should use. I'll share our ideas about where asyncio is headed and what to expect in Python 3.7.
