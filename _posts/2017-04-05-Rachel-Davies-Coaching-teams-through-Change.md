When you come to a conference like this, you pick up new ideas that you’d like to try when you get back to work. However, you may feel like you hit a brick wall when it comes persuading your team to try the idea out. Resistance is very common in organisations large and small.

As an agile coach, Rachel has learned that forcing adoption of new practice results in minimal compliance. Teams who don’t want to try the new approach often fall back to old ways of doing things.

Come to this talk to hear some ideas about how to dissolve barriers to adopting new working practices and get your team moving in the right direction.
