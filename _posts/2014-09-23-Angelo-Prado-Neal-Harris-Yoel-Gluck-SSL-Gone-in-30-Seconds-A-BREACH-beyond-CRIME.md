For those not familiar with the compression based side channel attacks against SSL, this talk presented at Black Hat 2013 provides a detailed explanation of the CRIME and BREACH attacks, including the rather interesting and creative workarounds for eliminating data noise in order to increase the chance of a successful recovery of a given secret from the encrypted data, and also, a [live demonstration of hijacking the CSRF token](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29) of a real-world application. In the last segment, tips and tricks are provided for the mitigation of the attack.
