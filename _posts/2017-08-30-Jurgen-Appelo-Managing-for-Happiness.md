The research is clear: happy workers are more productive workers. Managing for Happiness is about concrete management advice for all workers. Practical things that people can do next Monday morning in order to make the organization a happier place to work, with people who run experiments and drive innovation. In this session, you will see how to manage the system, not the people. This is not only relevant for managers, but for everyone who is concerned about the organization.
