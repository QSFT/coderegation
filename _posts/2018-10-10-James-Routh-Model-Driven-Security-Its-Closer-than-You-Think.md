This session will explore five to seven different implementations of models (machine learning) that drive frontline security controls and what the journey was like in the implementation. The implementation approach started out as a "Big Data for security" program and resulted in six other independent implementations of machine learning driving frontline security controls that have talent implications.

Learning Objectives:

1. Learn why model-driven security is here today.
2. See how the implementation approach is not limited to large, sophistcated enterprises.
3. Understand why the growth of unconventional controls using models will continue.
