In the closing talk of this year’s MTP Engage Hamburg, John Cutler looks at why his Medium post 12 Signs You Are Working in a Feature Factory touched a nerve for so many people in product development.

There’s widespread tension in our industry, John says. While everyone talks about “outcomes over output” and says they strive for “real impact” with their craft, in our day-to-day work many of us simply give all our priorities and attention to shipping features.

Why is this? Are we powerless to do anything about it?

John had umpteen conversations with product managers after the publication of his initial article, and he came to the conclusion that at its core the issue is about trust (or the lack of it). we may all love data, he says, but it’s not a silver bullet and it will not solve any issue of trust inside a company.

Notes from our internal discussion:

- It's indeed humbling to think about how much less quality check is done for product work compared to dev work.
- The strongest feedback loop for product people is that it's usually them that need to take the hits and talk with outraged customers or salespeople. But that only happens when we screw up bad. If we just simply fail to create something exciting and great, it's never immediately evident.
- As John noted, there are indeed many cases when a feature factory is an efficient choice. A sizable portion of the keep-the-lights-up work around SPS belongs the this category. But there's indeed a lot that requires a lot more flexibility.
- We believe that the trust required is there in our teams.
- We should do functionality reviews more: just go back and look at all our features, even very old ones, and think long and hard about what would we change about them knowing what we know today.
- A fun metric about product work could be the number of "NO"s they say to feature requests. Or more generally speaking, how focused they keep a product-- because guarding and enforcing the product vision is still a primary task of a product person even in fully empowered & independent product teams.
