This session will be a deep dive into several real-world code snippets. With each sample, an analysis will be presented with a focus on data design, performance and compiler, and linker transformation details. Several iterations of each code snippet and analysis will be demonstrated, each leading further down the rabbit hole. The presentation will be limited to x64 CPUs.
