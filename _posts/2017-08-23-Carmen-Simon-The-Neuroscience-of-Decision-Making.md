Regardless of your job title, impacting people’s decisions is a vital component of staying in business. When you get others to do what you want (e.g., listen to your content, like you, share your ideas with others, buy your product, hire you, or promote you), you evolve. But how do you influence others’ decisions? Using neuroscience, this session provides a unique approach to decision-making. To get people to do what you want, you have to help them remember what you want. Influencing other people’s memory is the single, most important ingredient to decision-making and business success. Join this evidence-based session to discover how the brain decides, and learn how to stay on people’s minds long enough so they decide in your favor.
