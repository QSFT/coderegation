Digital identity is one of the fastest growing and fastest changing parts of the cloud. Zero-trust networks, GDPR concerns, and new IoT opportunities have been dominating cloud news coverage. In this session, learn about significant industry changes that will affect the way AWS approaches identity for both workforce and consumer customers.
