Mob programming is a development approach in which the whole team works on the same thing at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer. This is a whole team approach to doing all the work the team doesâ€”including coding, designing, testing, and working with the customers (stakeholders, product owners, users, and so on). This session takes a look at the practice and explores the benefits and some ideas you can try on your own team.
