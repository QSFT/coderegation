Do you like languages "designed for developer happiness"? Or do you find the structure and speed of a statically-typed and compiled language like C# more compelling? In this Cage Match, Jon Skeet (of StackOverflow fame) will go up against Gary Bernhardt (Rubyist, Pythonista, creator of the wonderful WAT!  video) as we run these languages through their paces. We might even make them change sides... putting Gary in front of Visual Studio and Skeet in front of Vim...
