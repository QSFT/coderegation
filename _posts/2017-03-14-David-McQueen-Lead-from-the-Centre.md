At the heart of every successful organization is a narrative that sets out what they stand for. Whether through strong branding, great case studies, customer service or people management this story is shaped in the vision, mission and values of these organizations. This story is the heartbeat that keeps them alive. 'Lead from the Centre' is aimed at business leaders who need to understand and learn how to build such narratives. Using the metaphor of a conductor and orchestra, and drawing from companies who have demonstrated leading from the centre, this speech is about practical tools and strategies of defining, designing and delivering great company narratives.
