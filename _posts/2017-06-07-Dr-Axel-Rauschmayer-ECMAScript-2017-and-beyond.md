In this talk, we’ll go into the latest JavaScript features and how they are designed.

Starting with ECMAScript 2016, the new “TC39 process” is used to create ECMAScript versions. We’ll start by learning how it works. Then we will take a look at the final feature set of ES2017, which was also created with that process and to which the last feature was aded at the end of January. Finally, we’ll examine what features are likely to be added to JavaScript after ES2017.
