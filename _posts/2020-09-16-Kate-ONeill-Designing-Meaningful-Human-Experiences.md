In this #mtpcon London keynote, Kate O’Neill, founder of KO Insights, considers the question: How can humanity prepare for an increasingly machine, tech and data-driven future?

Key Points

- We need to prepare society for an increasingly tech and data-driven future
- We must build products that create meaningful human experiences now and in the future
- To avoid the unintended consequences of our decisions, we must ask ourselves difficult questions throughout the product design process

Our won notes:
==============

- It was a first: we discussed the video while flying around Courchevel in FS2020 in beautiful sunny weather together :)
- It's indeed always a good principle to take a step back and look at whether your job makes people's lives better or worse.
- But it's a ridiculously tall order to require that all solutions and jobs to contribute to humanity. 99.9% of products and jobs just don't matter enough to make this a meaningful question. And we shouldn't consider that a failure or a job that's not important enough: a kindergarten teacher, a carpenter or a doctor at a local hospital will not improve the life of humanity but they are nevertheless doing important work and contribute to society.
- We found "Experience at scale = Culture" a really interesting thought.
