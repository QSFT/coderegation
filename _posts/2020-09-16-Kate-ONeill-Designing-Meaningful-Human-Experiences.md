In this #mtpcon London keynote, Kate O’Neill, founder of KO Insights, considers the question: How can humanity prepare for an increasingly machine, tech and data-driven future?

Key Points

- We need to prepare society for an increasingly tech and data-driven future
- We must build products that create meaningful human experiences now and in the future
- To avoid the unintended consequences of our decisions, we must ask ourselves difficult questions throughout the product design process
