What is "secure code"?
This session will introduce you to a safe mindset when developing applications. You will learn how to make the concept of trust a first class citizen in your code, how to make validation enjoyable (ok, at least not insufferable) and know what to look for when reviewing code for security vulnerabilities. Secure coding patterns will make your code cleaner, more robust and less likely to cause your user table to end up on pastebin.
