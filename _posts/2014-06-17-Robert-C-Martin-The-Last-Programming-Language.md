Recently, we've seen a return to languages invented in the '50s, '60s, and '70s. In this talk, Uncle Bob Martin asks "Have we explored the language space?", and -- if so -- should we stop exploring that space, and simply pick "The Last Programming Language"?

In the last few years we've seen a return to languages that were invented in the '50, '60s, and '70s. Clojure, Scala, F#, and even Ruby are derivatives of much older languages, and do not represent new ideas. This begs an important question: Have we explored the language space?

This question is not nearly so absurd as it sounds. We may, indeed, have completely explored all the different types of computer languages. It may well be that any new language invented will simply be a minor improvement of an older concept. In this talk, Uncle Bob Martin asked if perhaps it's time we stopped exploring that space, and simply picked "The Last Programming Language". What would that language we like? What attributes should it have? And is this idea wise?
