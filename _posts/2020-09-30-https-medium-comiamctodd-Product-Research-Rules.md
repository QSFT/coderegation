In this keynote from #mtpcon London, C. Todd Lombardo reminds us that as product managers we often make bad decisions. The key to minimising these, he says, is effective product research.

Key points:

All product managers make bad decisions
To minimise the number we need to spend time doing effective product research – a combination of user research, market research and product analytics
By getting more curious about your data and asking the right questions you can inspire action with insight
To be really effective you’ll need to build habits around your organisation so this happens constantly
