The creator of Node JS, Ryan Dahl, recently gave a talk at JSConf EU 2018 titled "10 Things I Regret About Node.js"

Here's some of the things he regrets:

 * dynamic languages are great for certain things. In a server though, you want things to be statically typed. (Probably why he wrote Deno in TypeScript and Go)
 * design mistakes:
    * didn't stick with Promises in Node (in the beginning), keeping them could have sped up async/await development.
    * security
    * build system (GYP)
    * package.json
