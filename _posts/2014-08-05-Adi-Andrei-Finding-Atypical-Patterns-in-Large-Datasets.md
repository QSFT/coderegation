A classical Data Science story, about identifying and learning unusual patterns in mountains of aircraft sensor data, that happened at NASA in the early 2000's. The project was successful and received many patents and awards, despite the fact that it was developed on machines that had less memory than the mobile phone in your pocket. The methodology developed then is still considered state of the art in Data Science today. It can be (and it is) applied in many other fields requiring unusual pattern discovery in large amount of data.

Adi Andrei is a senior data scientist who worked as a contractor for NASA, Unilever, Philips, British Gas and others.
