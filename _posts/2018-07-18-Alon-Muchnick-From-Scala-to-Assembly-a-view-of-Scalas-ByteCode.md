We all know and love our Traits, Objects, Lazy definitions and other goodies Scala gives us, but how are they really implemented under the hood ? Understanding what's going on underneath the covers of your code can be very beneficial and can lead to insights that may affect the way you write code. In this session we will take a deep look into the JVM to show how Scala does its magic by examining the bytecode that is being generated. We will also see how debug symbols can help IDEs debug our code and an easy and friendly way.
