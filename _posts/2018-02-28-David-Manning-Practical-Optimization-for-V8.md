Writing Javascript is fun, but writing performant code that makes efficient use of v8â€™s JIT compiler is a dark and arcane art. In the absence of clear answers, misinformation and superstition abound. Can we trust microbenchmarks? Should we try to write Javascript like C++? Can sacrificing a chicken on the first full moon of Spring really reduce garbage collection cycles? My talk will absolutely not settle all of these debates!
