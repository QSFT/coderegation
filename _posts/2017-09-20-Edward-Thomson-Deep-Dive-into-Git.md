Git is an incredibly popular version control system, used for small projects and large, for open source and in the enterprise.  But how does it actually work?  Git is very different from a traditional centralized version control system and understanding how it models history allows you to harness its power.  In this session you will learn about the internals of Git and how it actually works, making it both fast and flexible.  We will learn the fundamentals of a repository and how to successfully collaborate with other developers using Git.
