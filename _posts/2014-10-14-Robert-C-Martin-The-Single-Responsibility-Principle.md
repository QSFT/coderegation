In this talk, Uncle Bobe explains the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), which is one of the things that most people surprisingle get totally wrong, and also covers some related topics, for example, a typical misunderstanding about the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle. This NDC 2013 talk pretty much covers Episode 9 from the CleanCoders series, in some parts, even more.
