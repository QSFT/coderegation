Building on developers' intuitions to create effective property-based tests
Property-based testing is increasingly popular, yet the properties that developers write are not always effective at revealing faults. Developers often don't notice this, because it’s impractical to inspect all the generated tests. But they DO have intuitions for tests they would like to run. Many try to generalize these into properties, but this works poorly. In this talk, I’ll show another way to use those intuitions to build effective properties cheaply. I'll also show new features in Haskell QuickCheck that support this way of working.
