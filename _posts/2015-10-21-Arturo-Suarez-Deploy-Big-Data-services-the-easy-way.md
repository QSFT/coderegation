Big data solutions involve many technologies working together. Whether it’s collection, analysis, or action, all of those components must be configured, their relationships defined, and deployed. In today’s dynamic data environment, the deployment is bound to change, need to be updated, or replicated. You need an infrastructure and tool set that keep your focus on the data. Flexibility in big data infrastructure automation, and examples of use cases are discussed in detail in this webinar.

At this time we watch the live webinar instead of the recorded video.
