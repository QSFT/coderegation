Recently there have been some heated discussions regarding the AngularJS framework especially since the news regarding Angular 2.0, both in-house and in the JS community. Some say it's just a prototyping framework and should only be used for rapid prototyping and in throw-away projects, other are convinced that it is the way to go when it comes to frontend and even mobile, so let's find out if AngularJS has something useful in store for us.

ng-conf is a two day, single track conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 500 to 700 Developers from across the country will converge on beautiful Salt Lake City, UT to participate in training sessions by the Google Angular team, and other Angular experts. In addition to the invaluable training, ng-conf will deliver a premier conference experience for attendees, providing opportunities to network with other developers, relax at social events, and engage in some of the unique entertainment opportunities available in Utah.
