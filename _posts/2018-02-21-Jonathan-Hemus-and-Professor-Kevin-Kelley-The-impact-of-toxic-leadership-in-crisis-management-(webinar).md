Insigniaâ€™s Jonathan Hemus and Professor Kevin Kelley from the National Security Affairs Department of the US Naval War College discuss the impact of toxic leadership on crisis prevention, planning and management.

Describes some of the difficult to uncover destructive behavior that could result in the downing of a team and a company.

If possible, we should get the performance of Brent N. Cann on this topic, because I prefer his style of acting, slides and interpretation:
