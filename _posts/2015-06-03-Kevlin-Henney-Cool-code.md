In most disciplines built on skill and knowledge, from art to architecture, from creative writing to structural engineering, there is a strong emphasis on studying existing work. Exemplary pieces from past and present are examined and discussed in order to provoke thinking and learn techniques for the present and the future. Although programming is a discipline with a very large canon of existing work to draw from, the only code most programmers read is the code they maintain. They rarely look outside the code directly affecting their work.  This talk examines some examples of code that are interesting because of historical significance, profound concepts, impressive technique, exemplary style or just sheer geekines.
