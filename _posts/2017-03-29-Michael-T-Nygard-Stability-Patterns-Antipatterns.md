Once you hit Release 1.0, your system will be living in the real world. It has to survive everything the messy, noisy real world can throw at it: from flash mobs to Twitter. Once the public starts beating on your system, it has to survive--without you.

Did you know that just having your database behind a firewall can bring down your system? You'll learn about that and many other risks to your system. You will learn the biggest risks and how to counter them with stability design patterns. We'll talk about the best way to define the term "availability" and why the textbooks get it all wrong.

In this session, you will learn why the path to success begins with a failure-oriented mindset. I'll share war stories about antipatterns that have caused and accelerated millions of dollars worth of system failures. I'll share some of my scars with you so that you can avoid them.
