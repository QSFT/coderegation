Stack Overflow is a website that helps millions of developers every day. On the other hand, not many developers realize that this site serves them with incredible efficiency. For example, a question and answer page is typically served in 10ms.
How do you serve so many requests in so little time while running on 9 web servers? In this new talk, I will explain how this is planned, implemented and measured.

Marco is a developer in the core​ Q&A​ team of Stack Overflow since 2013. While not creating bugs and fixing them in a hurry, he enjoys blogging on sklivvz.com, covering computers topics from transistors to tech leadership.He frequently speaks on architecture, engineering and Stack Overflow.
