Once upon a time, a farmer was looking for help, so he interviewed a number of potential farm helpers. One young man catches his eye. The young man says: "I can sleep when the wind blows." And the farmer's like "What?! Sleep when the wind blows? What does that even mean?" But, the young man looked eager, strong, like he could do the work, so the farmer hires him.

Then, for the rest of the story, you gotta watch this talk. :-D
