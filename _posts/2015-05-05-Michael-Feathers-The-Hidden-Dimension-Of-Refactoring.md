We have a bias toward the current state of our code. Unconsciously, we assume that it has all of the information we need to make good refactoring decisions.  We can look at complexity, method length, class size and a number of other metrics but still, as we commonly use them, we see only a single snapshot in time.

In this talk, Michael Feathers will describe methods you can use to do trend analysis in source code repositories and use that information to make better refactoring decisions. Knowing where your code has been is the best way to decide where it should go.
