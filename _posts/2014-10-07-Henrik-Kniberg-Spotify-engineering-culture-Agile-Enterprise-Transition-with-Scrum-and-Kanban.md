topic: Spotify engineering culture - Agile Enterprise Transition with Scrum and Kanban
---

Spotify is a digital music service providing access to millions of songs. These two videos introduce a journey on which the company has gone and is going through, introducing how they use agile prinicples and methodologies to develop software and where they want to see themselves from a cultural point of view in the near future. They share some ideas that we could probably benefit from, or at least, they sound interesting to discuss, e.g. the in-house open-source model.
