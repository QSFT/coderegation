Pushing the boundaries of Agile, an interesting thing occurred: Core Agile practices began to disappear! This talk describes this phenomena, and explores the rationale behind it. Many of the contributing factors are rooted in social and architectural choices. The results have been spectacular both in business growth and traditional delivery metrics.

WARNING: this talk contains a bit where not writing (unit) tests is claimed to be a good idea, however, keep in mind that there's a context to it, which may not be applicable to every development team and software.
