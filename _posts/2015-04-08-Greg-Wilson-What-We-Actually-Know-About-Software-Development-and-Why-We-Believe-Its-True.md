What are our estimates good for? What factors affect team productivity and what don't? What metrics can predict the number of post-release bugs best? What evidence suggests that agile practices are better than waterfall? This quite thought provoking talk will attempt to get some questions answered and some answers questioned, and I really recommend watching it for everybody working with code or working with people working with code.
