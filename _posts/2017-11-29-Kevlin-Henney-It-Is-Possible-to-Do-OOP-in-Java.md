Actually, he barely mentions Java in this talk, but the ideas he's talking about, apply to most OO languages.

OO means different things to different people, but they normally focus on defining terms such as encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance, and talk about data abstraction, abstract data types and so on. In this talk we take a brief look at what one particular theory of OO suggests and what it means for regular Java programmers and their practice.
