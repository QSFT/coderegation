When designing datatypes, adding a type parameter is a simple expedient with a surprising variety of applications. This talk is a survey of datatype examples with functions operating on them in Haskell, to which we add a type parameter, stir, and observe the effects.

Attendees who prefer precise, unabstracted specifications in their datatypes should come away with new motivation to take a second look at datatype genericity; others may find one or two new tricks to add to their toolkits.
