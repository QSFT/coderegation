One of the problems we face in automated system testing is how to setup and manage the lifecycle of the included applications. Traditional virtualisation technologies can provide solutions to these problems, but at the price of heavy resources requirements and unacceptably long startup times.

Docker on the other hand, with lower resource requirements and shorter application startup times, has seen a lot of interest lately for looking like a better fit for automated system testing. In this session, I’ll showcase some neat ways in which Docker can be used in this area and challenge the common assumption that the costs of automated system testing outweigh the benefits.
