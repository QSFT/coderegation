Reinforcement Learning is a powerful technique for identifying the best actions to take to achieve a goal.

In this talk you will see some of the algorithms used to learn effective behaviours. In particular I will look at temporal differencing and how it can be used in conjunction with a recurrent neural network in a real time environment.
