Overview of the newest additions to Python 3.5, being released later this year.

Python 3.5, the latest installment of the language and library, is [just around the corner](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0478/) ([though you can try out the beta now](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-350b2/)). This session will cover some of the new syntax and library additions that should have people excited to start using it.

As a teaser, we'll look at better asynchronous programming, simpler mathematics, easier installation, better package management, formalized type hints, flexible function calls, and more!
