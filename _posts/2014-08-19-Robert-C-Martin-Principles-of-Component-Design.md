How do you manage the structure of large agile and object oriented systems?  What is the best way to break that structure into components? What should the components contain, and how should they be interrelated? How can we effectively partition a system into independently deployable components? This course teaches the principles of object oriented component design: Acyclic Dependencies Principle, Stable-Dependencies Principle, and Stable-Abstractions Principle.
