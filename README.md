MVP (Most Viewable Presentations) is a bi-weekly spontaneous event at [Balabit/One Identity](https://career.balabit.com/en), featuring the best selection of screencasts and conference talks related to product management. After watching the video we have a small discussion about the presented topic, while we can share our experiences or contrary opinions.

Its sister event is [Coderegation](http://balabit.github.io/coderegation/), make sure you check that one out, too.

If you would like to suggest a video, just create a [new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/QSFT/most_viewable/issues/new) with the URL and the details of the video. You can also vote there by adding a :+1: reaction. The next video is typically selected based on [the order of the :+1: reactions](https://github.com/QSFT/most_viewable/issues?q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc). And it is even better if you can host the event, which is not a difficult task: you should play the video on your laptop connected to the TV. That's all.

*Join us any time and get to be a better product person!*
