Coderegation (Code Congregation) is a weekly spontaneous event at [Balabit](https://career.balabit.com/en), featuring the best selection of screencasts and conference talks related to software engineering. After watching the video we have a small discussion about the presented topic, while we can share our experiences or contrary opinions.

If you would like to suggest a video, just create a [new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/balabit/coderegation/issues/new) with the URL and the details of the video. You can also vote there by adding a :+1: reaction. The next video is typically selected based on [the order of the :+1: reactions](https://github.com/balabit/coderegation/issues?q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc). And it is even better if you can host the event, which is not a difficult task: you should play the video on your laptop connected to the TV. That's all.

We also have a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUa_16Jxqfa0wo3_u8W2uNomtHr-w7fc0) of the watched videos.

*Join us any time and get to be a better coder!*
