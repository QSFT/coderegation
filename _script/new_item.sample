The convert.py script helps you to create a well-formatted item for the Coderegation blog post.

The header (everything in the first block) can contain the following attributes:

- date (required): it will be used to create the appropriate filename for Jekyll
- speaker and topic (required): for filename it will be converted to ASCII, and they will be normalized some way.
- video (opional): if you don't put the video here, you must add it yourself to the body of the blog post.

The header can be formatted as [Jekyll's front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/), and you can miss the tripple-dashes.

The script works from the filename called `new_item.md`.
